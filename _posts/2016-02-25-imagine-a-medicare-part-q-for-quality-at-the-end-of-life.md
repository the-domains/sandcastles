description: "I spent the last Sunday of my father's life sitting by his bed on the hospice unit in a small Connecticut hospital. He was dying of pneumonia, once called \"the old man's friend.\" There was a nondenominational chapel down the hall, and a sheet cake in the kitchen. His hand was warm."
