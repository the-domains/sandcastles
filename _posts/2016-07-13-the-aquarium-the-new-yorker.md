  On July 15, 2010, my wife, Teri, and I took our younger daughter, Isabel, to
  the doctor for a regular checkup. She was nine months old and appeared to be
  in perfect health. Her first teeth had come in, and she was now regularly
  eating with us at the dinner table, babbling and shovelling rice cereal into
  her mouth.
