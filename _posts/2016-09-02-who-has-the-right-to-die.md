  In her diary, Godelieva De Troyer classified her moods by color. She felt
  "dark gray" when she made a mistake while sewing or cooking. When her
  boyfriend talked too much, she moved between "very black" and "black!" She was
  afflicted with the worst kind of "black spot" when she visited her parents at
  their farm in northern Belgium.
