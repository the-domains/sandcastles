And I'm dying in a yearish.'</h1><p>The enormity of the news didn't sink in fully, not at first, even after my doctor uttered the words: "I'm sorry, we did find cancer."

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Death, the Prosperity Gospel and Me</h1><p>Durham, N.C. - ON a Thursday morning a few months ago, I got a call from my doctor's assistant telling me that I have Stage 4 cancer. The stomach cramps I was suffering from were not caused by a faulty gallbladder, but by a massive tumor. I am 35.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dfa2cd0388633fa68bfd8929b6b2aa760fa2d43e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The other day I couldn't even wrap my mind around the concept when our staff gathered to celebrate a retiring coworker.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2905f8100e858b3e52ca2a734af9c2ff3a6a2bda.jpg"></article>]]></description>
