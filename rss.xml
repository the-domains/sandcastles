            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Medicine's Search for Meaning</h1><p>Every day, we are reminded that the health care system is in crisis. We are going bankrupt. There are too many lawsuits. We practice defensive medicine. We restrict access. But surveys of doctors indicate a problem that penetrates much deeper than this.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/71410bc1209537b07c0b55700afc307a4a8420f4.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Imagine a Medicare 'Part Q' for Quality at the End of Life</h1><p>I spent the last Sunday of my father's life sitting by his bed on the hospice unit in a small Connecticut hospital. He was dying of pneumonia, once called "the old man's friend." There was a nondenominational chapel down the hall, and a sheet cake in the kitchen. His hand was warm.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5c605847b86446862e46096838a6a026804cb2af.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>When I'm Gone - Life Tips.</h1><p>Death is always a surprise. No one expects it. Not even terminal patients think they are going to die in a day or two. In a week, maybe. But only when this particular week is the next week. We are never ready. It is never the right time.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e5bfb141c4ce4d2141c51a2286dadbd351237ebe.jpg"></article>]]></description>

And I'm dying in a yearish.'</h1><p>The enormity of the news didn't sink in fully, not at first, even after my doctor uttered the words: "I'm sorry, we did find cancer." My husband, Dave, and I had only the faintest sense that evening that our lives had been hijacked forever.Early 2014 brought major surgery, then six weeks of chemotherapy...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/142ec26dfb4dee629b9551a28be6e39d0d229333.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Death, the Prosperity Gospel and Me</h1><p>Durham, N.C. - ON a Thursday morning a few months ago, I got a call from my doctor's assistant telling me that I have Stage 4 cancer. The stomach cramps I was suffering from were not caused by a faulty gallbladder, but by a massive tumor. I am 35.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dfa2cd0388633fa68bfd8929b6b2aa760fa2d43e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
