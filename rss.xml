            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Pacemaker Wrecks a Family's Life</h1><p>One October afternoon three years ago while I was visiting my parents, my mother made a request I dreaded and longed to fulfill. She had just poured me a cup of Earl Grey from her Japanese iron teapot, shaped like a little pumpkin; outside, two cardinals splashed in the birdbath in the weak Connecticut sunlight.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bcf3598515c6a4341179e5780508e20c6fb688b0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Top 5 Regrets Of The Dying</h1><p>For many years I worked in palliative care. My patients were those who had gone home to die. Some incredibly special times were shared. I was with them for the last 3 to 12 weeks of their lives. People grow a lot when they are faced with their own mortality.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Medicine's Search for Meaning</h1><p>Every day, we are reminded that the health care system is in crisis. We are going bankrupt. There are too many lawsuits. We practice defensive medicine. We restrict access. But surveys of doctors indicate a problem that penetrates much deeper than this.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/71410bc1209537b07c0b55700afc307a4a8420f4.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Imagine a Medicare 'Part Q' for Quality at the End of Life</h1><p>I spent the last Sunday of my father's life sitting by his bed on the hospice unit in a small Connecticut hospital. He was dying of pneumonia, once called "the old man's friend." There was a nondenominational chapel down the hall, and a sheet cake in the kitchen. His hand was warm.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5c605847b86446862e46096838a6a026804cb2af.png"></article>]]></description>
